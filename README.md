End-to-End Data Analytics Project: Retail Orders (Python + SQL)

Welcome to my end-to-end data analytics project! This repository showcases a complete data analysis workflow using Python and SQL, applied to a retail orders dataset. It highlights my ability to handle real-world datasets, clean and preprocess data, and derive actionable insights—making it a perfect fit for entry-level data analyst positions.

Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to work with retail datasets, from extraction and cleaning to analysis and visualization. Here's a high-level overview:

Data Extraction: Leveraged the Kaggle API to download datasets programmatically.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Used Python and Pandas to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis.

Database Integration: Loaded the cleaned data into an SQL Server database for querying and analysis.

Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and derived insights using SQL queries.
